 * Declare the reader's per-session presentation store.
 *
 * The handle is the registration currency of the `conversation.view` slot's
 * store seat: `slots.register` keeps the handle and asks it for one live
 * instance per session scope, so expansion choices and the motion preference
 * follow the session and persist under `dsh.reader.v1.<sessionId>`.
 *
 * `defineStore` must come from the DSH shell's shared
 * `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-store` seed module, never a local reimplementation.
 * The renderer's store seat calls `handle.create(scopeKey)` and reads
 * `handle.spec`; a hand-rolled handle without that shape makes the slot entry
 * throw `handle.create is not a function` the moment the tab is selected.
